                What happens when they run out of space? Are our homes and schools next to go?!

                Just got the bill back from my work incident. Two thousand dollars for the ambulance ride?? Healthcare is broken in this country.

                The doctor just said if I had reached the hospital ten minutes earlier I might still be able to walk from the injury. Too bad the hospital was across the river.

                    Hey, you're that new planner. I know it's easy for you to play with your little simulation, but your choices here really affect people. Think about what you do.

                    Local 451 has secured a contract with Oyle Enterprises here. Included are better protections so things like my leg don't happen again.

                    This city is deeply broken. Corrupt. Diseased from the inside. We've tried working through the official channels but nobody will listen.

                    They sacrifice our wellbeing in the name of constant, infinite growth. And you're complicit, planner.

                    Maybe if you had thought more about your decisions we wouldn't be here. There's a crowd outside city hall and they don't think too kindly on you.
