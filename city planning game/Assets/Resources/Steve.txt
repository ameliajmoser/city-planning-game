                The weather is so nice today! I wish I had a park nearby to enjoy it at.

                My son would love to join a baseball team, but the nearest park is too far away!

                I sure hope they don't let more oil plants get built any closer. I can already see them from my front door!

                I think I'll go for a walk around the city. There's so many new buildings I haven't seen yet.
