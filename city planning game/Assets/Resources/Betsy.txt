                Too many of our kids are forced to trek across the city just to go to school. We need more schools closer to home!

                There's a powerful stench coming from Casey's room... I worry they're smoking "Vapes" in there! Any #moms know what to do with this??

                    		And my teen Casey has been really enjoying the workshop classes they get there... I've never seen them so engaged with school! I just wanted to thank you for all you've done for this community.
