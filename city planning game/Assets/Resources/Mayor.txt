                    Now I can't begin to understand it, but apparently this here simulation lets you plan our city. We send you the building proposals, you plonk 'em down as you see fit, and they get built! What a time to be alive!

                    Those geniuses streamlined all the boring old political and budgetary concerns into those POINTS. So you can just focus on the planning, and make sure you get enough for the next round of proposals.

                    Oh, and they put some kinda app on your phone too. Apparently it keeps track of what people are saying about the city. But I've never been so good with those computers... My nephew usually does that stuff for me.
