                    Well howdy there kid! You must be our new city planner. I suppose I should introduce you to our fancy planning doohickey here!

                    Now I can't begin to understand it, but apparently this here simulation lets you plan our city. We send you the building proposals, you plonk 'em down as you see fit, and they get built! What a time to be alive!

                    You can navigate the world with your "WASD" keys, rotate with Q and E, and zoom with your "SCROLLWHEEL." Drop buildings with "RIGHT CLICK" and rotate them with "SCROLLWHEEL."

                    Those geniuses streamlined all the boring old political and budgetary concerns into those POINTS. So you can just focus on the planning, and make sure you get enough for the next round of proposals.

                    Oh, and they put some kinda app on your phone too. Apparently it keeps track of what people are saying about the city. But I've never been so good with those computers... My nephew usually does that stuff for me.

                    Good luck, kid! Don't let us down.

                    I didn't want to be the one to tell you this, but... aw shucks. It looks like our budget has run thin for this period.

                    It's nothing personal, but with how tight things are getting we're gonna have to cut this experimental planning program.

                    I was hopin' to retire soon but it looks like I'll be holding down the fort here until things stabilize.

                    As for you, kid... I guess you'll have to find work elsewhere.
